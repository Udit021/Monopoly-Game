🏙️ Python City Property Game

A console-based mini Monopoly game built in Python

This project is a simplified version of Monopoly, where players roll dice, move across Indian cities, buy properties, and pay rent to other players. The goal is to maximize your net worth through smart buying and strategic luck!

🎮 Features

🎲 Dice-based movement system – Roll to move, get a 6 to start your journey

💰 Dynamic money assignment – Starting cash decided by a dice roll

🏘️ Property buying and rent system – Purchase cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore

⚖️ Bankruptcy & elimination – Players can go bankrupt and leave the game

📊 Automatic net worth calculation – Determines the richest player at the end

🧾 Easy expansion – Add more cities, rules, or features easily

🧠 How It Works

Players enter their names (2–4 players).

Each rolls a dice to get their starting money.

Roll a 6 to start moving around the city map.

Buy unowned cities or pay rent when landing on owned ones.

After 20 turns (or if one remains), total net worth decides the winner.

🗂️ File Handling (Coming Soon)

Future updates will include saving player progress, city ownership, and game history using file handling.
